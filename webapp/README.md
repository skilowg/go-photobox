# Go Photobox Web Application

Best practices on writing front-end applications are still a nascent concept
in the Go ecosystem. Therefore, we have to borrow a lot of what we know
from the JavaScript ecosystem to bootstrap our web app build.

This is a [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) project built
with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).

# Installing Dependencies

* Install a recent version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system
* Navigate to the `webapp` folder: `cd webapp`
* Install dependencies: `npm install`
* Build the web application: `npm run build`
* To continuously build web app files as you work on the project, run `npm run watch`

# Testing

This is still a `TODO` :)
